2239 - Find Closest Number to Zero

Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums.
If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1

Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
Output: 1

Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
